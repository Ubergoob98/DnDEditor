This program will be made with the true idea behind quick character creator for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition.
This will be a program in the works and shall be completed over time. Github updates will be pushed to the Discord server
for updating all the users interested in DND.

This program will feature a page full of character inputs that will be then logged into a seperate file.
then the program will then pull the information from that and place it into a html page designed like the Dungeons and Dragons Character Sheet.
Then the user will have a chance to either print or save the html document as writeable pdf or a png.

This program is going to be edited with the base purpose for quick character creation.
mainly for DM's to make easy NPC Stat Blocks, or making a quick charcter to throw into the campaign.
this can also be used for users who want to make a quick character then flesh it out later. 
lets say the users previous character dies. this will be able to make another character in approximately 2 minutes.


The user entry can be as complex and detailed as they want picking and choosing everything down to the GP, or it can be as little information and
the program will do a quick selection of traits, skills, spells, and so on so forth till the character creation is complete.
